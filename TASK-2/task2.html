                    <b>EDUCATION : </b> Indira Gandhi wa taught at home by tutors and attend school 
                    intermittently until matriculation in 1934. She was a student at the Modren School in Delhi,
                    St. Cecilla's and st.Mary's Convent school in Allahabad, the International School of Geneva, 
                    the Ecole Nouvelle in Bex, and the Puplis Own School in Poona and Bombay, which is affiliated
                    with the University of Mumbai. She and her mother Kamala moved to the Belur Math headquarters
                    of the Ramakrishna Mission where Swami Ranganathananda was her guardian. She went on to

                    It was during her interview with him that Rabindranath Tagore named her Priyadarshini, 
                    literally "looking at everything with kindness" in Sanskrit, and she came to be known as 
                    Indira Priyadarshini Nehru.A year later, however, she had to leave university to attend 
                    to her ailing mother in Europe. There it was decided that Indira would continue her
